  "Mod Description","\nThe aim of ISC is to greatly expand the functionality and scope of the audio in Skyrim\. Literally thousands of new individual sounds have been created for the game\.\n\nNo longer will you hear the same generic thud when an NPC or creature dies and falls to the ground\. No longer will creatures like wolves\, draugr\, etc cycle between a small repetitive pool of 4 or so universal footstep sounds no matter what surface they traverse\. Moving around now always reflects the type of armor you are wearing\. Picking up items will much more consistently provide appropriate audio feedback for what kind of item you are looting\. A swing from a greatsword being parried by a 1\-handed axe now reflects the elements of both weapons clashing and not just a nondescript generic parry sound\. Powerful\, high level shock spells now send thundering reflections across the vast outdoor distances\, while remaining more confined if cast indoors\. Etc etc etc\.\n\nThe goal is to have all of these small disparate elements add up and provide a more varied\, dynamic and reactive audio experience\. Ultimately this is also a significant boon to how the entire gameplay feels as there is simply more appropriate feedback for the actions in the world\.","fomod\\images\\isocomp.jpg",\
