## Proprietary Tests
This is a folder for storing wizards for testing that can't be uploaded to GitHub due to licensing issues.
The gitignore is set up to ignore all `*.txt` files placed in this folder, so simply drop them here and you can use git commits without fear of accidentally uploading proprietary files.
