RLO_Readme = str("Realistic Lighting Overhaul \(RLO\) is the fourth iteration of the popular lighting mod, Realistic Lighting without Post-Processing.\n\nIt is a complete overhaul of the games lighting system and is one of the most comprehensive lighting mods available for Skyrim. The changes number in the thousands and cover many bases. The aim of this mod is to make the lighting as realistic as possible within the confines of the game engine. It makes the lighting more realistic without the use of screen shader injections or other post-processing. This means the changes made to this mod only utilize the game engine and changes are only made via the Creation Kit. So this means there will be no performance decrease at all, in fact, some people might even get an FPS boost from using this mod due to the removal of bloom which takes up considerable processing power from older machines. We are also optimizing RLO so that it may even run FASTER than vanilla Skyrim in some instances.\n\nThis mod does not aim to make the game fantasy like, or add lights for the purpose of it looking beautiful on screenshots. This is a hardcore realism mod, that should be used by people who want their game to have an increased immersion level. Sunlight will be realistic and not blue and places which are poorly lit WILL be dark. If a cabin only has a few candles, yes it will be dark, don't blame us, blame Bethesda \(haha\) because we are trying to keep this \"lore friendly\" and realistic as we can, even with huge engine limitations.\n\nThis mod adds a vast amount of sun lighting to cells , more shadow casting lights and bounced lighting \(Over 600 new shadow casting lights as of v4.1\). The lighting in RLO is very subtle and very balanced and many of its features can be missed if people are looking for a more -in your face- fantasy approach. This is why we only really tell you about a few main features and the rest is up to you to experience.\n\nIf you want fantasy lighting with over the top (for cinematic purposes) boom and effects, edited meshes etc - I would recommend looking for other mods, such as Climates of Tamriel or Enhanced Lights and Effects, which are mods we also adore and use!\n\nRLO while complex in it's own way - does not edit meshes or textures, it does not use scripts. We do this to lower the chances of bugs or issues to your game. As of 4.1 RLO added some fixes for cloud textures to suit RLO weathers. 5.0 will introduce meshes and textures for smoke effects. All of these will be optional.\n")
