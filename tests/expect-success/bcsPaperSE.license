Author notes:

You don't need ask me for permission to use the contents of this mod for any reason. You have it.
You can add to, subtract from, alter, enhance, embellish, patch, improve to your hearts content. This is meant to be a starting point for others to improve on, not a be all end all mod. I only request ONE things in return.

1) You acknowledge the work I've done, and the work of those that I have credited. Rome was not built in a day and neither are mods. We all stand on the shoulders of those who came before us. Give credit where it is due.

====================================================
