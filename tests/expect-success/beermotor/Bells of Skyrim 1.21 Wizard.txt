MOD_Readme = str("BELLS OF SKYRIM\n\n\nDescription\n\nEver wondered why the game\'s official trailer shows us a ringing alarm bell during the dragon attack\, but there is no such thing in the game? This mod fixes that and adds those bells. When a dragon attack happens\, the guards will ring the bell, alerting citizens.\n\n\nHow it works:\n\nThe mod places bells at the major cities. There are guards that are associated to the bells; and if they notice a dragon\, they will run to the bell and ring it until the combat ends. They\'ll do this automatically. If a player activates the bell outside of a battle they will also turn it off. Citizens and other guards will also react to the bells and act accordingly. Guards will unsheathe their weapons and search for an enemy\, while citizens will flee..")
