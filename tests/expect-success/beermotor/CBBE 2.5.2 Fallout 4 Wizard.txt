By default there are three nude options available that don\'t require anything but installation\, as well as lore-friendly underwear styles for these body shapes \(using Beth\'s own unused underwear meshes\)\.\n\nThese meshes have a total of over 21k vertices - compared to the vanilla body\'s modest 1750 - for optimal smoothness\. In tests there have been no reports of these high-poly meshes causing any slow down\, but may still be too much for weaker systems to use\, so be warned\.\n\nIncluded in the main installer are bodies\, textures\, all vanilla and DLC outfits\, and BodySlide addons for the body and outfits\.\n\nThere are also morph files for the body and the outfits included\, which are used for in-game morphing with LooksMenu or other script mods.")
