SMIM_readme = str("Skyrim is the greatest open-world RPG ever created and includes fantastic 3D character and creature models. However, playing the game for even one hour made me notice Skyrim also contains many ugly 3D models. More precisely, there are quite a few low-polygon static meshes that comprise the architectural elements, clutter, furniture, and landscape objects.\n\nIt would appear that while the artists devoted a large amount of time to create the races, creatures, armors, weapons, and major buildings, the more \"boring\" 3D models that make up the game world were severely neglected.\n\nHence, this mod edits many 3D models to improve their appearance and to fix many of the ugly seams and other oddities. I started in February 2012 with the ultimate goal of improving about 500 of the worst offenders. In June 2014 750+ meshes have been completed; my goal has been exceeded with over 15,000 placements of said meshes! In October 2016 900+ meshes are improved, with over 30,000+ placements! Cool.\n\nStill, SMIM still has more to do! Improving meshes takes a long time, and I'll release incremental updates to include new 3D models as I finish them.")

	"|Skyrim Special Edition - Everything","You MUST be playing Skyrim Special Edition for this option! All improved meshes will be installed using SMIM\'s high resolution textures. One click goodness! \n\nDo not pick this if you're playing the original Skyrim, obviously!","--- Screenshots ---\\EverythingSE.jpg",\
	"Skyrim Special Edition Lite - Same as XBox One Lite","You MUST be playing Skyrim Special Edition for this option! This installs the recommended meshes and textures for a moderately lite install as used in the XBox One Lite version. The differences compared to the full install is as follows:\n\n-Farmhouse ropes are 3D but fade at distance.\n-No 3D chains in Whiterun \(mainly the drawbridge\).\n-No 3D stockade ropes in order to reduce load times for areas like East Empire Trading Co.\n-No 3D Solitude ropes since this may reduce performance on the docks.\n-No 3D Riften ropes since this may reduce performance on the docks.\n-No smoothed Mountain meshes since these use a large number of polygons.\n-No 3D bones in the Dawnguard Soulcairn bone piles since these use a large number of polygons.\n\nSo if you want a lite version that still has most of the stuff pick this version. Also pick this version if you want to pretend you're an XBox One. Eh eh eh. Do not pick this if you're playing the original Skyrim, obviously!","--- Screenshots ---\\SMIM_CoverImage_Bnet-XBoxLite.jpg",\
	"Skyrim Special Edition Very Lite","You MUST be playing Skyrim Special Edition for this option! This installs the basic mesh fixes and performance-friendly improvements. You still get all the common furniture, food, dwemer clutter, nordic tables, non-Real Roads bridges, lanterns, skeletons, hawk, longhouses, carriages, juniper and tundra trees, rings, bowls, sconces, and a lot of other stuff. The differences compared to the full install is as follows:\n\nSAME AS LITE \(XBOX ONE VERSION\)\n-No 3D Chains in Whiterun \(mainly the drawbridge\).\n-No 3D Stockade Ropes in order to reduce load times for areas like East Empire Trading Co.\n-No 3D Solitude Ropes since this may reduce performance on the docks.\n-No 3D Riften Ropes since this may reduce performance on the docks.\n-No smoothed Mountain meshes since these use a large number of polygons.\n-No 3D Bones in the Dawnguard Soulcairn bone piles since these use a large number of polygons.\n\nADDITIONAL REMOVED IMPROVEMENTS\n-No 3D Farmhouse ropes since these add a large number of polygons to most towns and villages.\n-No 3D Chains for various objects like hanging herb racks.\n-No 3D Chains for Signs.\n-No 3D Chains for Pull Levers.\n-No smoothed Blackreach rocks or Generic rocks meshes since these use a large number of polygons.\n-No 3D Shack Roofs since these add a large number of polygons to small shacks and settlements.\n-No highly detailed 3D Chests.\n-No 3D Windmills.\n-No high polygon Rabbits \(both alive and the dead hanging variant\).\n-Uses Chandeliers without 3D chains in order to save a large number of polygons.\n\nThis no longer uses the Half-Sized textures option as compared to the Original Skyrim Lite SMIM install. I figure in the year 2016 Half-Size textures don't matter on nearly all moderate hardware. Do not pick this if you're playing the original Skyrim, obviously!","--- Screenshots ---\\LiteSE.jpg",\
