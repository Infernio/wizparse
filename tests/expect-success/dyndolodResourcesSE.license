Author notes:

Everything in the DynDOLOD package is free to use, so if anything from DynDOLOD like scripts, meshes, textures, generated LOD, modified or not, is used in mods or as resources for mods it should be free as well.

If LOD generated by DynDOLOD is used in the game, you are required to make good looking videos or screenshots and upload them to the Internet. As long as access to the good looking videos and screenshots is available for free and public consumption, they can be monetized and content/media creators can be compensated for their work.

Generally, donations, patreon etc are fine. Commercial use is not.

Crediting DynDOLOD or Sheson is the right thing to do and appreciated.
