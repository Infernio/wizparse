Author's instructions:

Do whatever you want with the wizard.txt file.

With everything else in the mod, you should follow the original mod's permissions and/or contact HGEC's maintainer/author(s).

====================================================

This is taken to mean that redistributing the wizard file, without change to its license, while acknowledging the original author and the file's source, is acceptable.
