# wizparse

[![CI](https://github.com/Infernio/wizparse/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Infernio/wizparse/actions?query=workflow%3A%22CI%22)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

A new parser / interpreter for BAIN wizards based on [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/).

## Parser
The parser is generated from an ANTLR4 grammar.
This should hopefully also make it easier for other projects to use it.
It is found in [wizards/wizard.g4](wizards/wizard.g4).

It supports everything listed in the [BAIN wizard documentation](https://wrye-bash.github.io/docs/Wrye%20Bash%20Technical%20Readme.html#wizards), but has some breaking changes since the previous parser was *very* lax.
See [Breaking Changes](Breaking%20Changes.md) for more information.

## Building & Testing
Still a bit rough because it was designed for CI, but see the [scripts](scripts) folder.
In short:
 1. Make sure you're on Linux. You're on your own on Windows.
 1. Make sure you have Java 8 and that it's the one you're currently using.
    For example, on Arch Linux, check with `archlinux-java status` and switch with `archlinux-java set`.
 1. Run `./scripts/prereq.sh`. This will download a copy of ANTLR.
 1. Run `./scripts/build.sh`. This will generate a Java parser and compile it.
 1. Run `./scripts/test.sh`. This will run all tests in the tests folder.
